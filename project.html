        <h1>Chicken</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the red junglefowl,
            originally
            from
            Southeast
            Asia. They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
            junglefowl,
            and green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called
            a
            cockerel.
            A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature
            female
            is
            called a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or
            as
            pets.
            Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
            domesticated
            for
            meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.</p>

        <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
            as
            of
            2018,[2] up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world than any other bird.
            There
            are
            numerous cultural references to chickens—in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and
            literature.

        <h2>Terminology</h2>
        <p>An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster, and an adult female is called a
            hen.[9][10]

            Other terms are:

            Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[11][12]<br>
            Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]<br>
            Chick: a young chicken[13]<br>
            Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[14]<br>
            Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[15]<br>
            Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[16]<br>
            Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[17] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually
            immature<br>
            chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[18]<br>
            Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)<sup><a href="asdf.com">[19]</a></sup><br>
            Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[20] In fact, chicken was originally
            a
            term<br>
            only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, and still often in trade and
            scientific
            contexts, chicken as a species are typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21]<br></p>

            Salamanders are a group of amphibians with a lizard-like appearance, including short legs and a tail in both larval
            and adult forms.

            Several species of salamander inhabit the temperate rainforest of the Pacific Northwest, including the Ensatina, the
            Northwestern Salamander and the Rough-skinned Newt. Most salamanders are nocturnal, and hunt for insects, worms and
            other small creatures.
